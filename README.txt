Install
=======

The code is based on the fast and efficient computation of multi-body dynamics.
For this purpose, we use RBDL - an efficient rigid-body dynamics library using
recursive algorithms.
The library can be installed from::

  https://bitbucket.org/rbdl/rbdl

The detailed documentation can be found here::

  http://rbdl.bitbucket.org/


Action Points
=============

[ ] Install 'RBDL' with python bindings
[ ] Manuel will create 'HeiCub' model with python bindings
