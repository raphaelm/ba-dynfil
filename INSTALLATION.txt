* Install Python 2.7, virtualenv and pip

* Install Python-level dependencies with
  pip install -r requirements.txt

* Install custom RBDL version with the modified IK by Kevin Stein and Manuel Kudruss
  ("rbdl-modified-20161206")

  Run cmake with the following options (for Arch Linux):
      cmake .. -DRBDL_BUILD_ADDON_LUAMODEL=ON -DRBDL_BUILD_ADDON_URDFREADER=ON \
               -DRBDL_BUILD_PYTHON_WRAPPER=ON -DLUA_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/include/lua5.1 \

  Required Arch Linux packages: lua51

  Make sure to execute cmake and make within your Python virtualenv, then the python
  versions will be automatically correct.

* Set your PYTHONPATH such that it includes the build/python/ directory from RBDL, e.g.
  export PYTHONPATH=../rbdl-modified-20161206/build/python:$PYTHONPATH
